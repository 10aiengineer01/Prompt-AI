## Installation and Setup

To use the AI-Promptcreator project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual Python environment:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix/Linux/MacOS
venv\\Scripts\\activate     # For Windows
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

Create a .env file in the project's root directory with the following contents:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
or/both(depends on what you want to use)
GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_BROWSERLESS_API_KEY"
```

Replace the placeholders accordingly. Then run the pb_agent_os.py and the system will create a prompt, with all information and print everything in the terminal.
